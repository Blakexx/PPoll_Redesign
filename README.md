PPoll is an anonymous ad-free solution for polling groups of any size. Our simple to use interface makes it easy for new users to answer and create polls instantly! Choose between a Dark and Light mode to customize the look and feel of PPoll, or censor inappropriate content with the Safe Mode. Discover publicly created polls with our browse feature. Attach images to polls by simply selecting them from your image gallery or taking a picture.
